In this work, we investigate a modified gravity model $ f(Q,T) $ with holographic dark energy. By considering the holographic principle as an extension to cosmology, we explore dark energy as a result of the entanglement entropy of the universe's horizon. We employ the Barrow holographic dark energy model, incorporating quantum corrections, and use the Hubble horizon for the infrared cutoff. Through parameter estimation using MCMC with the latest supernova, BAO, and Hubble data, we find that the model alleviates the Hubble tension and provides consistent results with the standard cosmological model. Additionally, the model successfully describes the accelerated expansion of the universe. Despite the complexity and additional parameters introduced by the model, it offers a promising framework for further exploration of dark energy within modified gravity theories.
