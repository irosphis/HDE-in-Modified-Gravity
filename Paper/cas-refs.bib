  abstract = {The ultimate fate of the Universe, infinite expansion or a big crunch, can be determined by using the redshifts and distances of very distant supernovae to monitor changes in the expansion rate. We can now find1 large numbers of these distant supernovae, and measure their redshifts and apparent brightnesses; moreover, recent studies of nearby type Ia supernovae have shown how to determine their intrinsic luminosities2,3,4—and therefore with their apparent brightnesses obtain their distances. The {\textgreater}50 distant supernovae discovered so far provide a record of changes in the expansion rate over the past several billion years5,6,7. However, it is necessary to extend this expansion history still farther away (hence further back in time) in order to begin to distinguish the causes of the expansion-rate changes—such as the slowing caused by the gravitational attraction of the Universe's mass density, and the possibly counteracting effect of the cosmological constant8. Here we report the most distant spectroscopically confirmed supernova. Spectra and photometry from the largest telescopes on the ground and in space show that this ancient supernova is strikingly similar to nearby, recent type Ia supernovae. When combined with previous measurements of nearer supernovae2,5, these new measurements suggest that we may live in a low-mass-density universe.},

  abstract = {We present measurements of the baryon acoustic peak at redshifts z= 0.44, 0.6 and 0.73 in the galaxy correlation function of the final data set of the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We combine our correlation function with lower redshift measurements from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey, producing a stacked survey correlation function in which the statistical significance of the detection of the baryon acoustic peak is 4.9σ relative to a zero-baryon model with no peak. We fit cosmological models to this combined baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data set comprising six distance–redshift data points, and compare the results with similar cosmological fits to the latest compilation of supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The BAO and SNe data sets produce consistent measurements of the equation-of-state w of dark energy, when separately combined with the CMB, providing a powerful check for systematic errors in either of these distance probes. Combining all data sets we determine w=−1.03 ± 0.08 for a flat universe, consistent with a cosmological constant model. Assuming dark energy is a cosmological constant and varying the spatial curvature, we find Ωk=−0.004 ± 0.006.},

The χ2 fitting is found to be slightly better than that in homogeneous models. It is shown that (1) the best-fit values are most sensitive to the ratio R of the outer Hubble constant, H0II, to the inner Hubble constant, H0I, (2) the best-fit outer density parameter, Ω0II, and cosmological constant parameter, λ0II, are, respectively, increasing and decreasing functions of R, and (3) (Ω0II, λ0II) can be (1, 0) for R ≈0.8. Moreover, it is shown that these models are naturally consistent with the new supernova data (SN1997ff) with z = 1.7.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a rise in interest in the geometrical trinity of General Relativity and its extensions. This interest has been fuelled by novel insights into the nature of gravity, the possibility to address computational and conceptual questions—such as the determination of black hole entropy or the definition of gravitational energy–momentum—from a new perspective. In particular, f(Q) gravity has also inspired numerous works on black holes, wormholes, and cosmology. In the latter case, f(Q) models have the potential to elucidate phenomena in both early and late-time cosmology without necessitating the inclusion of dark energy, the inflaton field, or dark matter. Particularly noteworthy is the role of f(Q) theories in addressing cosmological tensions, presenting exciting possibilities for reshaping our understanding of gravity and its manifestations in cosmology. The emergence of intriguing new black hole solutions and the potential existence of wormhole solutions suggest the presence of novel physics within the realm of strong gravity. These phenomena have become increasingly measurable only in recent times, opening up exciting avenues for further exploration and discovery. This review is tailored to students and researchers alike. It offers a self-contained and pedagogical introduction to metric-affine geometry—The mathematical foundation and indispensable tool upon which the geometrical trinity of General Relativity as well as its various extensions are built.}

We assume that the infrared cut-off relevant to the dark energy is the size of the event horizon. With the input ΩΛ=0.73, we predict the equation of state of the dark energy at the present time be characterized by w=−0.90. The cosmic coincidence problem can be resolved by inflation in our scenario, provided we assume the minimal number of e-foldings.}

We extract the general metric and affine connection field equations, we apply them at a cosmological framework, and adopting three different types of symmetric teleparallel affine connections we obtain the modified Friedmann equations. As we show, we acquire an effective dark-energy sector of geometrical origin, which can lead to interesting cosmological phenomenology. Additionally, we may obtain an effective interaction between matter and dark energy. Finally, examining a specific model, we show that we can obtain the usual thermal history of the universe, with the sequence of matter and dark-energy epochs, while the effective dark-energy equation-of-state parameter can be quintessence-like, phantom-like, or cross the phantom-divide during evolution.}

Here, we consider two special classes of f (T, B) model and reconstruct their exact forms by taking power and hybrid expansion law's de-Sitter case into account. The obtained solutions are then examined through the graphical analysis of EoS parameter and null energy bound for each model. It is concluded that all reconstructed models favor the current accelerated expansion regime by representing phantom cosmic epoch or de-Sitter model for different scenarios. Also, the graphical analysis of null energy condition indicates its validity only for one case, while for other cases it remains invalid. Furthermore, we explore the stability of these reconstructed models by applying a perturbation technique. It is found that the power law and de-Sitter solutions both show stable behavior against the introduced linear, isotropic and homogeneous perturbations.},

Our goal is to understand how the universe evolved over time. To do this, we use parameterizetion of Hubble's parameter method. We then use a powerful tool called Monte Carlo Markov Chain to find the best values for the constants in our formula. We do this by comparing our formula to actual data from observations of the universe. Once we have the best values for the constants, we calculate other important parameters that describe the universe's evolution. These include: Deceleration parameter which measures how quickly the expansion is slowing down. We found \$q\_0 = -0.601{\textasciicircum}\{+0.0131\}\_\{-0.0131\}\$. Equation of state parameter to measures the properties of dark energy. We find \${\textbackslash}omega\_0 = -0.7018{\textasciicircum}\{+0.0101\}\_\{-0.0101\}\$.

It is shown that the Hubble horizon as an infra-red cut-off is suitable for both the models to explain the recent accelerated expansion.

  abstract = {In this paper we consider the non-viscous and viscous holographic dark energy models in modiﬁed f (R, T ) gravity in which the infra-red cutoff is set by the Hubble horizon. We ﬁnd power-law and exponential form of scale factor for non-viscous and viscous models, respectively. It is shown that the Hubble horizon as an infra-red cut-off is suitable for both the models to explain the recent accelerated expansion. In non-viscous model, we ﬁnd that there is no phase transition. However, viscous model explains the phase transition from decelerated phase to accelerated phase. The cosmological parameters like deceleration parameter and stateﬁnder parameters are discussed to analyze the dynamics of evolution of the Universe for both the models. The trajectories for viscous model are plotted in r-s and r-q planes to discriminate our model with the existing dark energy models which show the quintessence like behavior.},
